# MagiNews iOS App Setup Guide

## OpenAI API Configuration

To use AI-powered features like article summarization and translation, you need to configure your OpenAI API key:

1. **Get an OpenAI API Key:**
   - Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

2. **Configure the API Key:**
   - Open `MagiNewsIOS/Services/SummarizationService.swift`
   - Find line 70: `self.apiKey = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"`
   - Replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key
   - Example: `self.apiKey = "sk-your-actual-api-key-here"`

3. **Security Note:**
   - Never commit your API key to version control
   - In production, use secure storage or environment variables
   - The current setup is for development purposes only
